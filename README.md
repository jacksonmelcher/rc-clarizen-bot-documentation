## Commands

Right now, Clarizen bot understands a few commands. For help with syntax please refer to the [syntax section](#Syntax). For the sake of simplicity `state` and `status` arguments have been split into two examples:

#### Status

```
{ project | task } status [ on-track | off-track | at-risk | not-active ]
```

The first argument determines whether you want a `project` or a `task`. The second argument can be `status` or `state`. `task status` is a valid command and will return **all** tasks and their statuses. This is true with `project status` as well.
You then have the **option** to filter by the status (`on-track`,`off-track`,`at-risk`, or `not-active`) of the `project` or `task` by appending one of those keywords to the end of the command. Example: `project status on-track` or `task status off-track`

#### State

```
{ project | task } state [ active | completed | cancelled | not-active]
```

The first argument determines whether you want a `project` or a `task`. The second argument can be `status` or `state`. `task state` is a valid command and will return **all** tasks and their states. This is true with `project state` as well.
You then have the **option** to filter by the `state` (`active`,`off-track`,`cancelled`, or `not-active`) of the `project` or `task` by appending one of those keywords to the end of the command. **Projects or tasks that are labels as `draft` will not be listed.** 

Example: `project state completed` or `task state active`

## Examples

-   `project status` - Lists all `projects` and their `status`
-   `project state` - Lists all `projects` and their state
-   `task status` - Lists all `tasks` and their `status`
-   `task state` - Lists all `tasks` and their state
-   `task status on-track` - Lists all `tasks` with a `status` of `on-track`
-   `task state cancelled` - Lists all `projects` with a `state` of `cancelled`
-   `project status at-risk` - Lists all `tasks` with a `status` of `at-risk`

To shorten commands Clarizen bot also recognizes aliases. Please refer to the [alias section](#Aliases)

### Aliases

| Keyword      | Alias |
| ------------ | ----- |
| `project`    | `p`   |
| `task`       | `t`   |
| `status`     | `stu` |
| `state`      | `sta` |
| `on-track`   | `on`  |
| `off-track`  | `off` |
| `at-risk`    | `ar`  |
| `not-active` | `na`  |
| `active`     | `a`   |
| `completed`  | `co`  |
| `cancelled`  | `ca`  |

Examples:

-   `p sta` - `project state`
-   `t stu off` - `task status off-track`

### Syntax

##### Required commands

-   Required commands look like this: `example`
    -   this means you must type `example` or the command won't work.
-   Required commands where there is a choice are wrapped with `{}`.
    -   `{yes | no}` - means you must choose `yes` or `no` or the command won't work.

##### Optional commands

-   Optional commands are wrapped in `[]`
    -   `[cat | dog]` - means you can choose to add cat or dog at that location but its not required.
